I am not only a fiction, but also a technical writer as [Thomas Pynchon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon) did. In 1960 he was hired as a technical writer for Boeing Aircraft Corporation in Seattle, Washington. That influenced the author’s grammatical tendencies, an economy of prose, that allowed him to function within the Boeing-USAF communications system while maintaining an original style that his contemporaries at Boeing remember well. One of Pynchon’s contributions to the Bomarc Service News was a narrative voice that inculcated confidence and engagement in readers amidst the complex and exacting work of maintaining a continental defense system. This synthesis of personnel and technological apparatuses was key to Boeing’s innovation in large-scale systems integration, but it also factored importantly Pynchon’s narrative development.

Technical documentation is a generic term for the classes of information created to describe (in technical language) the use, functionality or architecture of a product, system or service.
